Welcome to Sama Sama Coffee
Your friendly neighborhood café in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. At Sama Sama Coffee, we believe coffee is more than just a drink—it’s a daily ritual, a shared smile, and a way to bring people together.

Our Story
Founded in 2015, Sama Sama Coffee began as a humble café tucked in a leafy corner of Bangsar, with a mission to bring people closer through good coffee and warm conversation.

Inspired by Malaysia’s melting pot of cultures and rich natural landscapes, our founder, Amira, travelled across Southeast Asia—from the cool highlands of Vietnam to the jungles of Borneo—sourcing beans from small-scale farms committed to ethical growing practices. Today, our house blends feature handpicked beans roasted locally to reflect the unique flavors of the region.

Every cup tells a story: of early morning kopitiams, pasar tani banter, and the joy of slowing down over sips of something made with heart.

Delivery & Areas We Serve
Whether you're working from home in Bangsar South, people-watching in TTDI, or chilling at Perdana Botanical Gardens, our delivery team brings your favorite brew straight to your doorstep. We currently deliver to Bangsar, Mont Kiara, TTDI, Damansara Heights, and parts of KL Sentral.

One tap away, our delivery service ensures you never miss your kopi moment—no matter where you are in the city.

Our Menu
From rich espressos and smooth lattes to decadent dark drinking chocolate and flaky pastries, our menu is curated for all-day comfort and indulgence. We serve fresh bakes daily, including buttery croissants, hearty scones, and classic biscotti—perfect pairings for your coffee.

Looking for something healthier or halal-friendly? We’ve got dairy-free milk, sugar-free syrup options, and a growing list of vegetarian treats to keep everyone included.

Community & Sustainability
At Sama Sama, we’re more than a coffee shop—we’re part of the neighborhood. We partner with local artisans, bakers, and social enterprises to support Malaysia’s creative and small-business scenes.

Sustainability matters to us too. That’s why we use compostable packaging, locally sourced ingredients, and offer RM1 off if you bring your own cup. We also host monthly events, from open-mic nights and batik workshops to pop-up book clubs and charity drives.

Working Hours
We’re open every day, rain or shine:

Monday to Friday: 8 AM – 9 PM
Saturday: 9 AM – 10 PM
Sunday: 9 AM – 6 PM

Whether you're popping in before work, catching up with friends over brunch, or winding down with a book and a cappuccino, Sama Sama Coffee is your go-to spot for feel-good coffee and connection.
